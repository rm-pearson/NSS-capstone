# NSS capstone: Trends in Juvenile Literature

One day, reminiscing with friends about our favorite childhood book series, we became curious – which of our favorites from the 90s and early 2000s are still popular among kids?  Which ones were just a fad?  What new series will Generations Z and Alpha be nostalgic for?  
  
Using data from the Seattle Public Library (SPL), I intend to analyze trends in juvenile literature from 2006 – 2025 to determine which titles and series have had staying power over the last 20 years, and which had only brief moments in the spotlight.

## Questions
