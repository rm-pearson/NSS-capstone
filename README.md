# NSS capstone: Trends in Children's Literature  
  
One day, reminiscing with friends about our favorite childhood book series, we became curious – which of our favorites from the 90s and early 2000s are still popular among kids?  Which ones were just a fad?  What new series will Generations Z and Alpha be nostalgic for?  
  
Using data from the Seattle Public Library (SPL), I intend to analyze trends in children's literature from 2006 – 2025 to determine which titles and series have had staying power over the last 20 years, and which had only brief moments in the spotlight.  
  

## Data Questions  
- Which books have been the most popular children's titles during the covered time period?
- Which titles had moments of popularity that they did not retain?
- Which titles have been consistently popular?
- Do "classics" remain popular, or do young readers favor new releases?  
  
  
## Data  
Data was sourced from the [Checkouts by Title](https://data.seattle.gov/Community-and-Culture/Checkouts-by-Title/tmmm-ytt6/about_data) dataset available from SPL at data.seattle.gov  
  
  
## Tools  
Data was imported, cleaned, analysed, and visualized using Python in Jupyter notebooks.
