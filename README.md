One day, reminiscing with friends about our favorite childhood book series, we became curious – which of our favorites from the 90s and early 2000s are still popular among kids?  Which ones were just a fad?  What new series will Generations Z and Alpha be nostalgic for?
Using data from the Seattle Public Library (SPL), I intend to analyze trends in middle grade fiction and library reading at large from 2006 – 2025.  With the data limited to Seattle, these results may not be completely generalizable, but should give us an idea of titles and genres that retain their staying power over generations.
